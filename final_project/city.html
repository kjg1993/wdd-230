			<h2 class="headline-1">Malecon 2000</h2>
			<p class="paragraph-1">
				One of the characteristics that distinguishes Guayaquil is its immense
				boardwalk around the banks of the Guayas River to the east of the city.
				Also called Malecón Simón Bolívar, it is the meeting place par
				excellence thanks to the friendly climate, the attractions to see and
				the gastronomic options.

			<h2 class="headline-2">Santay Island</h2>
			<p class="paragraph-2">
				When it comes to tourist places in Guayaquil, it is almost a must to
				visit Santay Island, connected to the city by a pedestrian bridge of
				more than 800 meters built just for the enjoyment of tourists and
				locals. Isla Santay is rich in flora and fauna and the mangroves are its
				main feature. The bridge can be crossed on foot, by bicycle or with a
				vehicle (there is parking on the Island

			<h2 class="headline-3">Santa Ana Hill</h2>
			<p class="paragraph-3">
				It is the only viewpoint in Guayaquil that offers a 360-degree view of
				the city. You can see it everywhere! From the source of the Guayas River
				to the north, to the commercial center of the city to the south. At the
				foot of Cerro Santa Ana is the Barrio Las Peñas, a picturesque and
				emblematic place in the city with colonial-style houses and a lot of
				history to discover among its streets founded in the 16th century, hence
				its tourist attraction.

			<h2 class="headline-4">Iguanas park</h2>
			<p class="paragraph-4">
				Very close to the boardwalk and the Moorish Tower is the home of the
				iguanas, that is, the Seminary Park where you can feed these animals
				with pieces of lettuce that the caretaker delivers. It is a square that,
				at the time, was the Plaza de Armas, it was also called the Bolívar Park
				but today it is known for the presence of a community of friendly
				iguanas that allow themselves to be portrayed without problem by
				passers-by.

			<h2 class="headline-5">Botanical Garden</h2>
			<p class="paragraph-5">
				If the walk with iguanas leaves you wanting more nature, visit the
				Botanical Garden of Guayaquil. Orchids, water sources and thousands of
				unique plants will welcome you. The biodiversity of Ecuador is known and
				this place offers a great summary of species of birds, mammals and fish.
				Take advantage of visiting them in the mornings.

			<h2 class="headline-6">Moorish Tower or Clock Tower</h2>
			<p class="paragraph-6">
				This is one of the ideal tourist places in Guayaquil to take the perfect
				postcard photo of your trip to Ecuador. It is an emblem of the city and
				has been standing since 1931. However, the clock on top of the Moorish
				Tower dates from 1800 and was brought from Europe as a gift to the city.
